{"name":"Quantumcomputings14","tagline":"Quantum Computing, summer 2014","body":" I am working on developing a numerical algorithm for optimal control of quantum states, in the presence of stochastic measurement. This algorithm will extend GRAPE and existing techniques for the solutions, and allow more sophisticated states (such as entangled qubits) to be generated and used. Additionally, quantum feedback will be optimized for the purposes of error correction and quantum teleportation. These goals are reflected in the main branch, but addtionally, Miles, another intern, will be working on his version of a similar project using the same code.
