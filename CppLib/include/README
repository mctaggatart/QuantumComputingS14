This folder contains all the header files for the project. A short description of each is included below.


AnalyticControl:Attempts to find an analytic starting point for the code:
 AnalyticControl(const matrix<complex<double> > &Hcontrol,const double dt,const size_t num_time, const size_t nsubpixels, Evolution* evol, char* filename=NULL) 

Control: Handles control. Gaussian starting moved to here

Evolution: Computes evolution of the progress and the gradient.

GrapeTransfer:

GrapeUnitaryCavity:

GrapeUnitaryQubit:



Matrix: useful matrix class

MatrixExponential:

MatrixOpperations: Handles matrix operations such as dagger. Uses namespace MOs

NumericalIntegration:

OptimizeEvolution: Optimizes evolution. also implements Khanja phis, and unitary transfer

OrdinaryDiffEqs:

QuantumOperation:

RobustGrape:

SpecialFunctions:

spMatrix:

standard_definitions.mk-make file

standard_makes.mk handles linking

StatisticalFunction:

SweepOptimization:

TicToc: Timer class

UsefullFunctions:Assorted useful functions like sleep, bubblesort: Namespace: USs, required extensive editing of COUTs to be compliant.
