On 06/06/2014 I worked on compiling the code. The following edits were made:
Include/UsefullFunctions.hpp:
Set the default parameter of 

Changed findmax to have different code inside and std::abs(y_values[i]) instead of ABS(y_values, i)
Added std:: in front of all instances of vector and cout and ofstream. This is due to the change in compilers.

Include/AnalyticControl.hpp
Edited derivative and other functions to have a default paramater in the contstructor. This is for  complex<double>** sys_params=NULL because we set sigma =0 before it and it won't compile unless you add defaults for all paramaters after it

Also installed several libraries. 

 sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev
 sudo apt-get install gsl-bin libgsl0-dev


At least one of those contained the correct libraries that were missing.
